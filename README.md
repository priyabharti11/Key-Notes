<h4>Key Difference and Definition of Library and Framework</h4> 
<h5>
- The key difference between a library and a framework is "Inversion of Control".<br>
- When you call a method from a library, you are in control. <br>
- But with a framework, the control is inverted: the framework calls you.
</h5>
<h4> Framework</h4>
 
<h5><p> - In a framework, all the control flow is already there and there are many predefined white spots that we should fill out with our code.<br>
        - A framework is normally more complex. It defines a skeleton where the application defines its own features to fill out the skeleton.<br>
        - In this way, our code will be called by the framework appropriately.<br>
        - A framework can contain libraries. A framework will usually include many libraries to make your work easier.
   </p> 
</h5>

<h4> Libraries</h4>
<h5> <p>
- A library performs specific, well-defined operations.<br>
- A library is just a collection of class definitions. <br>
- The reason is it simply code reuse, in other words, gets the code that has already been written by other developers.<br> 
- The classes and methods normally define specific operations in a domain-specific area. <br>
- For example, there are some libraries of mathematics that can let developers just call the function without redoing the implementation of how an algorithm     works. <br>
- A library will usually focus on a single piece of functionality that you access using an API.<br> 
- You call a library function, it executes some code and then the control is returned to your code. </p></h5>
